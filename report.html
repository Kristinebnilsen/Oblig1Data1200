          <h2> Inclusive design: </h2>
         <p>In the restaurant-website that's been created, we´ve tried to make it as universal as possible. It is important that everyone (regardless of need) gets the opportunity to use the site in a satisfactory way. It is a website for a restaurant, and we want everyone (children, adults and elderly) to be able to use it. It needs to be as easy as possible to navigate and give people the information that they need.
         </p>
          
      <h2> Simple language/font size: </h2>
      <p>Initially we started by focusing on the language and font size, when we wrote in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The idea was to avoid slang, difficult words, abbreviations, hyphens and an unsuitable font size. Language can affect accessibility for those who have reading difficulties, and the font size will be decisive for those who have poor eyesight. To make people understand which dishes contain different allergens, we have made these words thicker, including a text that explains this. Therefore, there will be no misunderstanding and easy for everyone to order what they can and can't eat.
          Making a website simple (simplifying language and font) does not necessarily mean that it is not smart for a user's understanding. This is rather done to ensure accessibility for everyone, regardless of age or disability (Sandnes, 2018, p. 26-27).  
      </p>
      
      <h2> The alt- attribute/various buttons: </h2>
      <p>The images included on the website have an alternative solution if they are not displayed. 
          We have been using the alt-attribute, as it should be an option if the images do not appear.
          At the top of the website, we have two pictures of different main dishes that our restaurant serves. If the images are not displayed, there will be an alternative text describing these. 
          If the image is read out by a screen reader, we have avoided starting the option in HTML with "An image of" since it is already read out this way by the screen reader. This prevents sentences from being repeated several times. 
      </p>
          
      <h2>Semantic: </h2>  
      <p>Having a page that is semantic is appropriate for several reasons. It will make it easier to use assistive technology. It also becomes more understandable for us who create the website, and for the screen reader or other special tools to understand the purpose of the various elements.
      <p>

          
      <h2>Changes between first and second page: </h2>  
      <p>From the first edition to the last, we ended up making some changes to make the website more inclusive. Starting off, we had a plain and simple website which was easy to understand, but were missing a few things. For instance, you had to scroll down the page to find different information on the page; the menu and the contact information. The improved page has buttons to click on. When you click on them, the page will scroll down for you, to navigate you to the exact place you want. Another thing we improved was the placing on the side. We chose some different colours, for instance green on the allergens, which matches our header foto. In addition, we placed the logo to the left, to make more space for and make the buttons bigger on the right side. We discussed that bigger buttons would be easier for people to see, which again makes the page a lot easier to use.
